This event took place in the summer after 8th grade. My dad revealed to me and my older brother (Richard) that I had a 9 year old sister. Finding out I was an older brother took me by surprise since I had always been the youngest of the family. That same day we met and I couldn't think of anything to do other than get to know my nine year old sister. After being overwhelmed which such news, me and my older brother's greatest fear was not being able to see her anymore which concluded on me and him not telling my mother. The problem begins. Once my mother found out through a text on my dads phone, the whole household was at chaos. For about 4 months I can't think of a time I was home without an argument. My mother didn't speak to me for about a month which was the most challenging part of the whole situation. At the beginning of the chaos I made the decision to join some clubs to be occupied and not be home. I joined football. Football was my escape of the arguments, lectures, and mainly the depressing environment at home. After I joined football my whole mood changed. I was a happier, competitive, and fit person. After school it would be practice then homework and sleep. No time for any of the negativity at home. After a year or so things at home started to regulate themselves. My mom forgave my dad and most importantly me and my brother. The only bad outcome that is still a problem currently is that contact with my little sister has been completely cut off, but I plan to come back in contact with her once we're older. 	I prefer to work as part of a team because I enjoy giving and receiving ideas, working as a team to pick the best one, and then building a successful project with everyone doing their own part. 	Last summer I was hoping to join this program but once I was placed on the waiting list I decided to sign up for other internships. The other program I attended was a mentorship at the Hearst tower. The mentorship was amazing for the solely fact of meeting the CEOs of many companies and even the editor for Cosmopolitan Magazine. Being able to ask questions and have one on one conversations with people who have thrived and struggled to get where they are inspired me to do better this school year and thrive in my academics and clubs.	If money were no object I would attend NYU. I would study to be a Dermatologist. A Dermatologist is a medical practitioner qualified to diagnose and treat skin disorders. I grew up with a skin condition named Eczema. Growing up with a skin condition makes you cautious of your environment, weather, and your supply of lotion at all times. Always having to be self cautions of my skin has allowed me to grow a passion for it. My only obstacle preventing me from achieving this dream is that at times I can be lazy which would affect my studies.  	https://askdfsk.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My parent/guardian recommended I apply		1	FALSE	FALSE

This class is the first time that I have ever been truly confused on what is going on and what am I doing. The struggle is not directly about the course, but my teacher. The teacher is useless to teaching us the core and developmental materials to understand the presented quizzes and test, starts random conversations. He hands the class countless worksheets that we are clueless to solving, then wait around two days after it is due to solve it in front of the class. He does not even give an explanation of how the material is solved, just gives us answers. The worst predicaments are the quizzes and test because he changes the layout of the material. When you show up for extra help he looks at the answer then solves the problem without explaining the material you need to know. He argues with concerned students questioning him about grades and class averages and becomes defensive when students tell him they are struggling. He presents us with questions we have not gone over nor on the study guides. Since the quizzes and test are different from the useless packets in class it has resulted in receiving very low grades causing students to drop out.   I have been teaching myself out of my textbook, study on Khan Academy + additional online math programs, seeing other teachers in addition to mine for extra help, speak to my guidance counselor, have scheduled tutoring sessions almost every Monday in order to receive a decent grade.	I have no problem with either or. I personally find both working alone and on a team similar because they result in a completion of a task. However, they differentiate by flexibility and structure. Working individually allows me to I manage myself at my own pace and ensure the completion of my task, use my own ideas and not be distracted. However, when working with a team, allows me to adapt to the group environment, enjoy the experience of sharing ideas, equally cooperating and contributing to the group to ensure the success of the task. In different events and situations, working as a team can be beneficial and equally enjoyable. I believe my open-mindedness, organization, and adaptability allows me to work well with others and solo.	Last summer I participated in Outward BoundÂ´s Oregon Rafting and Mountaineering Course. We navigated over and through mountains, rivers and canyons stretched across OregonÂ´s Central Cascades. The course expedition followed a 97-mile river trail through a memorizing scenic environment, the Deschutes River. The river was surrounded by a beautiful desert scattered with wildlife and unforgettable events. We learned about river hydrology, captaining skills, wildlife, Leave No Trace principles and basic camping lessons.Traveling down the river for the first six days of the course, you will learn paddle captaining skills, river hydrology, river safety, teamwork, campsite set-up, backcountry cooking and Leave No Trace principles. The last of days we spent hiking into the Central Cascades with 45-pound packs holding our clothes, sleeping bags, food and camp essentials. In the Cascade Mountains, we hiked through the snow at 10,000 and higher elevation. We trekked through the forest, relied on finding freshwater lakes along the way to cook, hydrate and utilize. We learned the importance of teamwork and the various roles that were assigned to us each day (cook, navigator, cleaners, recorder etc..) Today I can still visualize my experience I had that summer, from the friendship bonds to being truly emerged in the outdoors.    Last summer I also applied to All-Star Coding, however, I could not participate because I had already committed to Outward Bound. I did not want to hinder the chance of another individual to receive an amazing experience so I did not sign the pledge commitment form. I was very excited and I want to reapply again because I am still looking forward to trying something new by learning to code and immersing myself in the tech entrepreneurship industry.	If money were no object, I would want to study abroad for college. I believe that I will not only have the opportunity to learn in a new environment, but I would be exposed to what the world has to provide. My time abroad would give me exposure to new cultures, languages and a number of life experiences. In addition to studying abroad, depending on the area I go to, I will be able to develop and improve my language skills as a second language by experiencing it front hand and not just in a classroom.Studying aboard is so important to me because it will expand my interests, allow me to meet new people and ultimately help me develop my future.     In regards to my major, I would want to study either marine biology or a path in engineering focusing on the modernization of technology. I have always had a passion and excitement towards pursuing a career that improves marine life, solve global issues and utilizing my problem solving and creativity skills. I believe both areas of focus will allow me to tap into my strengths and explore things I am extremely passionate about. My time studying abroad in either field will provide me different perspectives on my studies that may not necessarily be provided in the U.S.     If anything would prevent me from achieving that dream it would be myself, because if I work hard and do what I have to do, I can achieve any dreams or goals I have set for myself.  	https://askdfsk.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	ABC recommended I apply, counselors and parents	3	TRUE	TRUE

I have been playing football for many years and last summer I attended the football camp in the month of August, I was important to me to attend this camp because I wanted to join the high school football team and I needed to work hard and prove my skills and talents that I have acquired during the years of travel team. I made the JV Sophmores football team by the end of the season I was moved up to the Varsity level and play the last few games with the team.

There was four teammates to a group and each teammate had a function. There was the team leader, the graphic designer, the coder and storyline creator. I was the coder, my math teacher had me learning basic coding in order to complete the project. I really enjoyed it. Ever since that project, I told myself I want to code.

I was in 9th grade at the time, and throughout my entire life, I was always good at math, whether I studied or not. I got hundreds in several test in sixth grade, and always had one of the top grades for Math exams and report card grades, but AP Calculus was completely different. I remember walking into the class on the first day thinking I was going to ace this class as the teacher had a good reputation for his students passing the AP exam. However, I was very wrong. Throughout the school year, I failed almost all quizzes and tests in his class and our teacher constantly reminded us that if you can't do well in this class, then you'll struggle severely if you want to be an engineer. I felt like I didn't belong in that class everyday and several people urged me to drop the class, but I knew that I didn't want to give up. At first I accepted that I wouldn't pass and accepted the 40s and 50s on test. However, one test, I got a 21 and from that moment on, I was determined to do whatever it took to pass his class and the AP exam. So I worked hard spending hours every night studying and then still failing tests.  However, I kept practicing and learned from my mistakes on tests. I made a gigantic leap and passed the AP Calculus AB exam. The entire AP Calculus experience taught me to be humble and to work hard for everything that you have and more importantly never give up without a fight.  	I prefer working as part of a team rather than working solo, but only if there is a good team. There isn't anything bad with working solo, but being part of team adds another element in problem solving as compared to working solo. That is because when working with a team, who shares the same goal that you do, that shares the same initiative and passion to solve a problem as you,  the element of teamwork arises. This element of teamwork combines brilliant minds and forms a variety of ideas and insights in solving a problem. The element of teamwork, in my opinion also provides a support group that eliminates any feeling of doubt or fear. Overall, a team saves time and makes the process of solving a problem more efficient as compared to working solo due to the element of teamwork.  	Last summer, I studied abroad in Beijing, China with 12 other kids across the United States in a program called Americans Promoting Study Abroad (APSA). I extended my knowledge in the Chinese language and culture, but more importantly I feel as if I opened my perspective and horizon in aasdfacitizenship and networking. I connected with people from the other side of the world and neglected our differences, but embraced our similarities. I met 12 other amazing kids from all of the United States and connected with them on several topics that are sensitive today. Lastly, I am assisting in opening the gateway for other kids across the United States to study abroad by volunteering as a web designer for a website, DOTTO.   	If money were no object, I'm not 100% sure what college I would go to since they are thousands of colleges in the United States, but I would most likely attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study mechanical or electrical engineering. When I was younger, I was always scared because I felt as I wasn't good enough to have a career in anything. Then I went to middle school and high school where learned my favorite subjects, physics, chemistry, and math/calculus and more importantly felt inspired by the impact of those subjects in society through engineering. The best college for engineering is MIT so that is why I would go there. However, the engineering field is very demanding on the mind and the body. The statistics show this as there are very few people of color going into the engineering field and that the engineering fields are one of the hardest to go through. However, I believe that no matter what college I go to, as long as I work hard and put my mind to become an engineer, I will become an engineer. 	https://askdfsk.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	SEED is to FRUIT	My friend participated in ASC (give name below)		2	FALSE	FALSE

This had me worried and didn't want to fail. I knew I needed to seek help to see what I was missing. So I ended up getting a tutor to assist me in my troubles, and it worked.	Solo because I am able to concentrate and think better single-handedly.	Last summer, my cousin came over to this country to spend time with my family. It was important to me because I hoped for 2 years that he would come to the U.S. and I finally got what I wanted.	I will love to attend Columbia University or Harvard.  The only thing that will hold me back will be the money to pay for it.	https://askdfsk.googleusercontent.com/eb1Q3M-1QAosKUg8eP1fzE0fqVzV9Ab1FtxBdn61_nipvCCVnMCe8OSZlIR37mWg2c3bduHcU2CfvCwrhoz4RSrMQVP88pXsw8l5m2k2m10N6EME3VWd551svwXAofcr4rgM019HctnekDw	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	School email	3	TRUE	FALSE
