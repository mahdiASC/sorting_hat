It was challenging because I thought I was doing fine by completing assignments and being interactive with lessons but what I soon found out was that I had to actually study and review my notes in order to perform the way I wanted to on exams. I would study with friends who were just as interested as me in getting the higher grades, and we would go topic by topic reviewing the content that was covered and going to be on the test.	I prefer working as part of a team because while I am confident in my skills and am able to work independently, I see value in the perspective of others. I think it's more important to work collaboratively than not because the process of revision and editing runs smoothly when there are more brains helping out. If I didn't work with other people, the only feedback I would get is on the final product, which wouldn't bode well if the final product wasn't the best I could've done.	Last summer I attended the Summer at Syracuse program at Syracuse University. The class I took was aerospace engineering and the experience I had there was something I could've never predicted. I got to receive insight into how living on a college campus was going to feel like and how the classes would operate. I also learned a lot about a field I'm interested in and ask questions about what it really looks like in the professional world. Besides what I had paid for at the program, I also learned about meeting people in college and how different it was than high school. It really altered my idea of how college would be socially because there was such a range of the types of people I spoke to. I think had I not attended the program, I wouldn't have been exposed to that feeling and I would still feel the same about the social life in college.	I don't have a specific university in mind but I would love to go to college in the north west. I also don't have a definitive major I'd like to study but I am interested in Engineering and Psychology.  For as long as I can remember, I've always thought to myself, "why?" because I find a lot of things I see so interesting. I'd question everything from why soda was carbonated to why racism existed. Through that curiosity I found that Engineering is somewhat of a way to answer those questions, and Psychology was applying those questions to the mind. Obstacles that might prevent me are my family's income and the prejudices and stereotypes that exist about people that look like me.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	2	FALSE	FALSE

They were basically teaching us how to make a website and also how to make an android app. At the end of the season, they told us to create a survey and make a website that might help the community or our school. I decided to make a website for our school clubs that would provide information about their different upcoming events and projects. The challenging part was definitely in making this idea come to life. How could I build out the website that I designed in my head? First, I used HTML to make the website, but this step only gave me basic foundations for how I imagined my website would be. I wanted to create a website that was attractive, but also very efficient. Then, my teachers suggested using CSS and Bootstrap. These were completely new tools for me. I became tired and even thought about quitting the project, but I did not lose hope because I am determined to learn how to code and create websites and applications that could make lives easier. I had some previous coding experience, so I relied on that knowledge to build on what I was learning with these new tools. I spent nights on the project and asked my teachers for help along the way. I finally completed the project, but even now, I am still working to make it even better.  	I prefer group work rather than individual work. I believe in the idea that “Teamwork Makes The Dream Work.” Working with a group helps us to manage our time precisely. When we work with a group of people it allows us to divide our work according to our individual strengths. In this way, a group can do the work accurately and efficiently. Teamwork also allows us to think outside of the box. When we work with different types of people,  we get different types of opinion. So the ideas come together and the collective group turns them into something much more powerful than anyone could have imagined alone. The most important reason is that teamwork allows each person to focus on his/her own strengths while learning new skills from others. If someone works alone he has to do all the work and could be stretched thinly. However, some people might argue that working solo helps them to work independently and not dependent on others. This statement is somewhat true but working in a group is important because it allows us to work more efficiently and helps us learn from one another’s diverse experiences and backgrounds.   	The last summer was the most significant time period for me because this is when I moved from Bangladesh to New York City, and my life changed forever. America - country of the brave, country of different cultures. Last summer was very crucial for me because every single thing was very much different than in my country. From the morning breakfast, through my commute to school and the public transportation system, until bedtime- I was facing lots of challenges getting used to my new home and its culture. But I survived.  My passion and determination helped me endure and keep an open mind and heart. I got admitted to the Marble Hill School for International Studies, and this was a great feat for me. Since last summer, every day has presented brand new tasks for me, and I am excited to face and learn from them.   	I want to build my life as an engineer in future. So I always want to such a college that will give me a strong base for me in future. If money were no object I would like to admit MIT(Massachusetts Institute of Technology) after graduating from school. I always thought that this college might help me for many purposes such as researching various things. Its strengths lie in the fields of engineering, science and technology, and its exclusivity involving students. MIT has world-class laboratories, world’s best professors,  and numerous other facilities. Although it is true that every engineering college offers the same opportunity but these were some unique about MIT that pursued me to join the college. But to get chance into MIT is not so easy for me. It's very hard and a little luck is involved if you are trying to get in on merit. Currently, I am living in New York. So It will be pretty hard for me to go out of state, and study there. As well there is a financial issue also. Because there is only one earning member in my family.   	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	WINDOW is to HOUSE	My principal/teacher/counselor recommended I apply	3	FALSE	FALSE

It was to research about a topic by finding two articles written in Spanish, listen to an audio as a third source, and write an essay all due the next day with 200 words or more. Although I am Latino, I do not speak fluent Spanish, so I had an additional task of translating my analysis into a language that is not native to me. Due to the fact that I am also in AP US History and had a heavy workload from that class, I could not start researching this essay until 11:00 p.m. I was already mentally and physically exhausted, and I had been sleep-deprived for the entire week. I felt overwhelmed with this extremely difficult tests of stamina, endurance, and the ability to work efficiently all at once, and I was worried that I wouldn't sleep at all. To accomplish this task, I went upstairs, splashed some cold water on my face, and made a promise to myself that I would finish this assignment and still get some sleep. I worked relentlessly at this essay, breaking down the Spanish articles and writing notes for the audio as fast as I could, all while having an outline of the essay in mind. I had to work all night, and even though I only got 10 minutes of sleep, I had still accomplished my goal. Never before in my life had I struggled that much with an assignment, but that night, I proved to myself that I can accomplish anything that I set my mind to.	It depends on the task at hand and who I am working with. If the task at hand is relatively easy and I can complete it in a short amount of time, I prefer working alone. I wouldn't want to have to rely on someone else to do a portion of my work and to wait on them if I can do everything according to my standards and if I know that I can complete the task fully and effectively. If I have assigned a major project or if I'm assigned something where I am not confident in my abilities to complete it, I would prefer working as part of a team. When working with a team that you can count on, an individual can learn from the other members of the group and parts of the assignment can be divided so that each members does one part. Afterwards, the group can share with each other their findings and educate one another on each answer, and if multiple group members completed the same part of the assignment, each member can write down anything that they missed to maximize the amount of learning that one can partake in.	Last summer, I was able to play piano for my uncle's wedding. Although the task may seem small and unimportant, it meant a lot to me; my uncle himself is an excellent multi-instrumentalist, and for him to call on me to play piano for his wedding showed how much he trusts me and respects my abilities. I was able to play without making any mistakes, and to watch the bride walk down the aisle while seeing everyone enjoy the music showed that I had accomplished the task at hand effectively and fully.	If money were no object, I'd look for a four-year college that would offer a variety of majors in many fields, particularly in music, law, and some with strong STEM programs. I'm not exactly sure which specific colleges I will apply to, since I haven't researched them yet. That being said, if money were no object, I'd probably apply to a college that I could go away and dorm, in order to receive the full college experience. I've always been interested in these type of careers, and I know that being in the law profession, at least, allows one to reap a considerably large financial reward. Some obstacles that might prevent me from achieving that dream would be a high volume of competitive applicants. Another obstacle might be the fact that I could be unsure of the major that I picked, forcing me to stay local until I figure out a major that I could pursue.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My parent/guardian recommended I apply	3	FALSE	FALSE

The class took a monumental departure from what I was used to, with the only method of grading being tests and participation grades, with very few opportunities for extra credit. In order to receive a passing grade in the class. rather then try to pass it by myself, I worked with every opportunity that passed by, whether it was classmates that understood the topic better then I did, people who already passed the class, or direct contact with the teacher for a better understanding of the topic.	I prefer working with others because once the project is over, everyone tends to learn and benefit from what the project was trying to give or teach.	Last summer, I had done extensive research on the latest technology, as well as brainstorm what edits I would make or add into my own versions when I get the chance to. I consider this to be an important hobby because it has practical use when I either create my own company that specializes in it or get hired by one. This is important to me, however, because of how interesting, useful, and practical I find technology as a general topic.	If money wasn't an object, I would go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and study as many courses in software and hardware development as possible.

My greatest challenge thus far has been 7th grade Spanish. In 7th grade, I did not understand Spanish. Most of my sentences did not make any sense and I was struggling and did not make any effort to study as much as I could have. I wasn't correcting conjunctions and I could not remember past tenses and my spelling was average. This lead me to receive grades I wasn't happy with. I then came to the realization that I needed to care more about my grades because not everything is a joke. I began to study to understand Spanish better and take Spanish seriously. In the end, my extra time in Spanish paid off and I passed seventh grade Spanish and now in ninth grade Spanish class speaking better Spanish and being serious.	 As an active member of my 8th grade Social Justice Project I realized that building strong communication with my team member was important to our success. Also, respecting points and perspectives were important because both of our ideas needed to be heard. I prefer workingin an environment with people that I can relate to as well as learn from and are my same age. During 8th grade Social Justice Project I worked as a team on Law and Justice. If I had done it alone I would not have succeeded as much as I did. As a team, we helped each other and built eacher up and made an amazing project	Last summer I worked in a Nursing Home in Far Rockaway, NY called Lawrence Nursing Home. I worked three days a week throughout the summer. I worked as a Dietary Assistant Intern. I made sure that each resident had the correct ticket stating what they can and cannot eat. I also logged the weight of each resident. This job was important to me because it was really the first actual job I have ever had. Even though I wasn't paid I enjoyed it. I enjoyed working there.   My grandmother is a patient at Lawrence Nursing Home and I was able to see two perspectives. I saw how senior citizens were nursed and I was taught  by nurses how to separate family members on the job. The hardest part was probably to separate time with family and work because my grandmother was a patient she was very protective of me and suffers from Dementia she feared for me a lot especially when it was time for me to go home. When I would go to staff nurses for assistance they were often scared for me and helped me when it was time for me to go home.  I was still six years old in my grandmother mind so the idea of me taking a cab alone was frightening for her. I understood my grandmother more and her disease.	 If money were no object I want to attend Harvard University. I am very interested in Chemistry and I would love to dive into the science of Chemistry and Writing. Harvard University is also the home of some of the most intellectual and successful people in the world. I know that can be a student at Harvard University and I can't wait for the day to get an acceptance letter. I would become part of the list of great thinkers and intellectuals  of  Harvard Universty. The obstacles preventing me from achieving this goal would be the tuition cost, building my math and Spanish grade point averages. I am willing and able to do what it takes to build my Spanish and Math grades up because I want it that bad and know that with the opportunity I will succeed at Harvard University.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eb1Q3M-1QAosKUg8eP1fzE0fqVzV9Ab1FtxBdn61_nipvCCVnMCe8OSZlIR37mWg2c3bduHcU2CfvCwrhoz4RSrMQVP88pXsw8l5m2k2m10N6EME3VWd551svwXAofcr4rgM019HctnekDw	71352	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	3	FALSE	FALSE

It was challenging because it was a high demand project. I had done about half of it when it was due, but I didn't turn it in so I could finish. Points were taken off because it was late, but ultimately I got a higher grade I would have gotten if I had turned it in as is.	I prefer to work as part of a team for many reasons. You can divide certain tasks, can check your work with your team, and possibly less stress than doing something by yourself.	Last summer I worked on a wooden music box.

I can work solo or with others when given a task.	Last summer I went to a sleep away camp in Vermont.  The camp is called Farm &Wilderness.  I have been going to this camp since I was about 10.  I have many friends there including staff members that are like family to me.  I feel like it’s a family reunion when I see them every summer.  I learn a lot about survival, I meet people from all over the world, I build things, I grow food, I swim, it’s cool.  Not only that there is nothing to do in my neighborhood during the summer.  Unfortunately  I aged out of the camp last summer, so 2017 was my last summer.  	I would study at Stanford University.  Stanford has a prestigious Artificial Intelligence lab.  Artificial Intelligence is very interesting to me but there is a shortage of minorities and women in this field.  The systems for AI are being designed unfairly and with bias according to an article I read in Bloomberg Technology.  The algorithms are trained to learn from the scientist using the software and over time pick up their biases.  That’s why it is important to have diversity.  I would like to be involved in this field of study so that my input will be considerd in the algorithms to sway a decision fairly concerning persons of color.  There are no obstacles except me not being focused and hungry for it.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My parent/guardian recommended I apply	2	FALSE	FALSE

I was nervous doing this whole project, because of this.  I ended up replacing words I struggled with, with synonyms so that I wouldn’t stutter.  When it was time to present, I ended up taking a deep breath and presented my project.  I focused on my voice and speech and it resulted in a very smooth and quick presentation.	I prefer working as a team because it leads to a smaller margin of error.  In addition, working with a team can help start relationships that can prove to be beneficial in the future.  Furthermore , working with a team creates an intellectual space where ideas can be created and shared . 	Last summer, I attended the STEP program which is located at BMCC. I chose to do, mathematics and Robotcis which i learned various skills.  I learn how to construct a robot and program it while using the LEGO mindstorms software.

Leaving the comfort of my city to attend a small boarding school in Exton, Pennsylvania was not the most exciting plan at the time. Learning to be independent was a task easier said than done. But, little to my knowledge independence was the last thing I needed.   The environment I grew up in didn’t promote the wellbeing of my education. A failing grade was disregarded with the simple shrug of a shoulder and sarcastic hi-fives from other classmates. Yet my mind remained overflowing with unrealistic goals and aspirations.   Church Farm School was different. The student body is mostly made up of low income, students of color, a unique characteristic for a private high school. Every student that makes up Church Farm School was using this unique high school experience as an opportunity for a better future. With the mindset I grew up with, I’m not going to lie, I struggled immensely. Yes, classes were difficult but my lack of care was what stunted me from achieving good grades. This pattern continued until the end of my second year at Church Farm School. It wasn’t until I began hanging out with people who truly cared about me and my future, a few you may be familiar with, Samuel Jurcic and Nathan Antwi, when I changed. All the people I surrounded myself with drove me towards success as well as a challenge. Within one year I nearly doubled my previous GPA and still strive for improvement. Now, whenever I struggle or fail I know there will be a helping hand to reach out, pick me up and push me forward.   When I look back at my first two years at church farm school and even before that I learned a lot from my mistakes. Yes, independence plays an important role in growth but what I needed was a support system. The brotherhood I gained at Church Farm School is something I hope can be replicated through All Star Code. I have a lot of growing to do, which comes with a lot of mistakes and struggles and you can never have enough helping hands to dust you off and keep you moving forward.  	I prefer working in groups because with a diverse set of committed minds no task stands too tall. If I were asked this question a year ago I probably would have preferred working alone but I came to a realization that a collective set of minds can accomplish far more than one. As a young man of color, I know the importance of diversity, and when working in a group the importance stands true. New perspectives and mindsets can give the leading edge over any solo worker or non-diverse group. Collaboration plays and overwhelming role in education and in the workforce and as our world grows more complex and advanced the importance of collaboration grows stronger and stronger.Obstacles and failure are an ineludible force when working, but how you rebound from those tribulations is what makes a successful project. With a group at my side, if I ever get off track and or fail I know there be someone to help me recover and put me back in place. 	I’m not going to lie or sugar coat anything, my last summer was pretty uneventful. I spent a portion studying for the SATs and the other portion regretting my decision of doing nothing. I really wish I spent my summer more productively and with this new feeling of motivation I gained this school year I hope All Star Code could kickstart my summers to be a lot more advantageous. Computer science is a foreign but interesting path as it’s such a relevant and growing field but I know what really interests me is business. Last summer me and a couple of friends wanted to start our own clothing line but like any other project, a business isn’t a business without execution. My friend and alumni of ASC, Samuel Jurcic told me about an organization founded my All Star Code alumni called Young Hackers and I feel as if All Star Code could influence and drive me, like the founders of Young hackers, to execute one of my business ideas.	If money were no object I would go to University of Pennsylvania, or Bates College as a more realistic choice. I would like to think that I’m an entrepreneur at heart. Leadership, resilience, open-mindedness, and dedication are all what make up a successful entrepreneur as well as what I embody throughout my everyday life. Truth be told I’m not 100% sure on what I want to study beyond my high school career but one things for sure is that I’m a businessman. I’m willing to hustle and grind my way to the top because, although it may sound cliché, forget being known I want to be remembered. I want to be the next Henry Ford, Bill Gates or Walt Disney.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	3	FALSE	FALSE

Last fall, I was apart of a theatre class that specializes in turning personal pieces in response to questions such as "What makes me me?" I wrote one piece that was about  my relationship with my parents that I do not normally tell most people. So for performing that same piece in front of people whom I barely know besides from rumors and gossips, I was nervous. In advance of the show, I talked with other members whom felt the same way and they reminded me of the times we had shared those pieces to each other. They helped me remember those moments and helped me gain confidence with those words. Instead of looking at the audience as strangers, I saw them as people whom came to see the real me. With that, I went through the piece and gave a stunning performance.	I prefer working as part of a team because I believe that it has more benefits that working solo does not have. The biggest benefit is having a variety of ideas shared, whether that be contemplating on solutions or problem-solving methods. In that place, I get to share my thoughts while listening to other ideas that I think produce better ones overall.	Over this past summer, I had the tremendous opportunity of having an internship with the HOPE Program. The HOPE Program is a nonprofit organization, located in downtown Brooklyn, that helps unemployed adults find a way back into the workforce through weeks of certification -building classes in computer skills, resume building, interview simulations, and internships. My job at HOPE consisted of building websites for the use of staff members, inputting information on the students into databases and attending meetings with other non-profit organizations in New York. HOPE has helped me deeply care about of the problems plaguing New York citizens, as well as my personal role in making change. 	If money were no object, I would go to college and be freely able to study any course without monetary profit being a goal. This dream is important t me because throughout my life, I have heard many people tell themselves that college and jobs equal finds the right major that will help you find monetary affluence. My parents once told me to start learning Computer Science to be able to find a high-paying job in that field. The idea that some courses are more important than others comes from the "how does it help me make money" thought. Without that mentality, I would freely be able to choose a wider range of studies, including Drama and Law. However, the biggest obstacle to that dream comes from family pressure and the overly expensive tuitions that many colleges have.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	A different organization recommended I apply (give name below)	2	FALSE	FALSE

I was involved in a custody battle between both parents for most of my life. Even thought I was emotionally neglected by my mother the courts were very slow to grant time with my father.   As time went on and I matured inwaa able to voice my feeling of neglect by mom and express the want to be with my father. My father was always involved in my life and pushed for me to strive academically.  When I turned twelve my father was granted full custody and my mother chose to no longer be involved in my life. I was a very tough pill to swallow and all though I don't agree with it I accept her choice.   Knowing my dad is always there provided me with the motivation to continue to succeed.	I prefer working solo because I don't want to look for anyone to blame if I fail. I take on the responsible of challeges reap the benefits of satisfaction of completing a task.	Sport are very important to me and I trained very hard during the off season for football to preapare for the upcoming season. That meant getting up early, training at the gym, going to work, and study for my SAT exam. The hard work paid off because I lead my team in rushing and we won out first playoff game since 2007.

I grew up with the same people my whole life,and  the transition from a 15 minute commute to an hour commute, to Manhattan,  took a toll on my 10 year old mind. Physically, it became a strenuous deal for me, and socially it took even more of a toll on me. I didn’t know how to open up to other kids because everyone in my old school knew each other. I didn’t have too many social skills to tackle a new environment.   The first month of my new school was quickly the hardest thing that I had ever had to deal with especially with there only being two other kids of color in my class. This struggle in my social life made me into a shy individual. I never spoke to anyone, and I couldn’t until 3:20 hit so that I could return to my home with people I knew. Not speaking to anyone didn’t seem to big of a deal at first, but it became apparent that my lack of speaking skills would be problematic whenever I needed help.  In public school, the environment was completely different because I used to be one of the most advanced in my class. I never needed to go to the teacher to get help in a subject. I used to be the one who used to help my classmates.  At the time, I believed that I was exemplary in mathematics until the topics in private school started to become increasingly difficult. So, when topics started to get more difficult, I decided to stay quiet because of my embarrassment.   Students who struggled in my middle school, were often ridiculed which made me become embarrassed of the fact that I was also one of those struggling kids. After seeing how the result of staying quiet hurt me,  I came to the conclusion that it was worse to stay quiet in order to quell my embarrassment than to face my fears and approach the teacher to receive the help I need to become the student that I was in public school , and the student I could be again. In public school, my thoughts were never floating to the fact I would need help, and with my change in seeking help, I realize now that there is no need to be embarrassed about struggling.   This decision to seek help changed me as a person because it made me realize that everyone has something that they are afraid of, and there is nothing wrong with realizing that it’s important to know that even best need help sometimes. What seperates from others, is the ability to put away your fears, and embarrassment, to reach out and get the help needed to make you the best you that you could possibly be.   	I work well in conjunction with others because in the majority of my courses,  I have to work collaboratively with my classmates.I  also work by myself.  Although I enjoy working individually, I've seen that it has been optimal to bounce ideas off of others which is why I have such a strong and positive reaction to working as a part of a team. 	Last summer, I worked with kids who attended under-resourced public schools in District 1. The program that I volunteered under was called the GO Project. This program helps struggling kids in public school get the help that they need to prepare them for testing in their school. In my volunteering, I worked the academic/morning shift which helped students in ELA/ Mathematics courses. I've volunteered with the GO Project for the past two years, and last year I worked with a second grade class. This was important because I connected with the students because they were just like me. When reading into this program, I was glad to see that there were programs to help children who needed help, and I wanted to be apart of the effort to help kids in need. This year I started doing the GO Project all year around, and this connection with the students gives me the drive to pursue this. 	Cornell University would my selection. My brother currently enrolls at Cornell, and is studying under the college of Arts & Sciences. During my visits to my brother, I see his enjoyment in his studies, and how much free range he has with the various classes in the college of Arts & Sciences. This peaks my interest, and is ultimately the reason why I would like to enroll at Cornell University. 	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	WINDOW is to HOUSE	Other (please specify)	3	FALSE	FALSE

I was going to install a new 2 Terabyte hard drive into my gaming console (PlayStation 4).  I grabbed a multitude of screwdrivers and screw driver heads and began to open up the insides of what made this machine work.  I unscrewed the hard drive from the console to gain access to the raw hard drive.  The hard drive was screwed to a metal tray , so began to unscrew it to remove the old hard drive from the tray.  All was going good until 1 out of the 4 screws was stripped.  After an hour of trying different screwdrivers and screwdriver heads I dug through my father's tools and ended up having to bring out the 2 pairs of pliers and a hammer.  I took the screw, grabbed it with the set of pliers and wrestled the screw out of the tray.  I had complete wrecked the tray in which the new hard drive needs to be in.  I took the hammer and I forcibly hammered the wrecked tray back into place.  After using a second pair of pliers to wretch the stripped screw from the old hard drive into the new one.  I put the screws into the new two terabyte hard drive and screwed it into the awkwardly bent tray.  I finally inserted the into the console and put the console back together.  The challenging part of this project was, problem solving my way through having that strpped screw.  Although this was a tiring and tedious process, instead I persevered through and I now have two terabytes of space on my PlayStation 4.	I prefer working solo as working apart of a team as you rely too much on others to get work done.  There is too much dependence on someone doing their part, as your always as strong as your weakest link.  If 1 person fails to meet expectation, then the entire group fails.  rather than deal with that I prefer to do things myself as it eliminates all possibilities of others ruining what you worked so hard for.	Over the summer I took law classes at New York University in NYC, with the program Legal Outreach.  Legal Outreach is a program that prepares urban youth from underserved communities in New York City to compete at high academic levels by using intensive legal and educational programs as tools for fostering vision, developing skills, enhancing confidence, and facilitating the pursuit of higher education.  Within participating in this program I traveled to NYU law institute where I learned and studied New York Penal law with other young men.  I ventured to many Law firms in the city as well as the Manhattan District Attorney's office.  In completing this program, I had to use what I had learned to participate in a fictitious trial in which me and the other scholars were split into prosecution and defense teams to argue our sides in front of a federal judge at the Thurgood Marshall Courthouse in New York City.  I was on the defense team and with preparation and perseverance my team and I were able to prevail over the prosecution to win the Trial.	If money were no object I would go to New York University to study criminal law.  There aren't many successful minority lawyers in our society, especially Afro-Latino ones.  I have a passion for learning and creating a just society and world for those me and who live in it.  There are natural societal obstacles that stand in front of me such as, my background and my race/ethnicity as I am an Afro-Latino male from Brooklyn, NY.  There is also the challenge of opening doors for myself.  Not many kids from my neighborhood leave they settle for what they have and sometimes don't have the resources to better themselves. Also being black and Hispanic you're often doubted and there is stigma that surrounds my capabilities and my skills are often in question, which are serious boundaries that not many pass.  	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	2	FALSE	FALSE

He showed me how to fix them and told me how I should start approaching problems in his exams, as well as any science course that requires critical thinking as a skill. At the end of that semester I managed to raise my grade up to a B+, for a B+ in the overall class at the end of the year.	I personally believe that I work better as part of a team.

Also, the more ways a team has to approach a problem, the more likely they are to succeed. 	I joined a Youth League for Ultimate Frisbee. Last year was the first year I joined a Sport's team in my school which was the Ultimate Frisbee team. Before that, I was so focused on academics that I never bothered to think about athletics or getting in shape. Joining a team has definitely changed my attitude towards athletics, and joining the Youth League was an opportunity to learn from professional Ultimate Players and improve myself for the next upcoming season. 	As of this moment, there are three possibilities. Two of the colleges I'm looking at are Penn State and Swarthmore, both located in Pennsylvania. I'm looking at these colleges because they both offer Astrophysics as a major, and the Astrophysics department in Penn State specifically is one of the best in terms of public colleges. One other possibility is going to college in Nagoya University, which is one I considered due to participating in a Japanese Science Exchange this year. One of the teachers who hosts the program said that one of his students went to study at Nagoya University for a relatively low-cost, but I'd still consider the opportunity if money didn't matter because studying abroad would be amazing! Some obstacles despite money that might prevent me from studying in the colleges I mentioned are the college process, and my grades. I don't have the greatest grades in my school and I sometimes think that I may not be suited to enter into a specific field if I don't get good grades in every single class. 	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	71352	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My principal/teacher/counselor recommended I apply	3	FALSE	FALSE

I weighted 180 pounds at only 5’4’’ and was constantly picked at for my weight. Even my friends, despite their good nature, told me I needed to lose some fat. During this time was when I started to feel depressed. I despised my body image and how it made me feel hopeless, worthless, and good for nothing. Luckily, I had a supporting family who understood what I was going through and did everything they could to make me feel better. They joked around, laughed, and gave me hope. They encouraged me to lose weight, but in a kind and friendly way. However, the turning point for me was when the doctor said that if I continue to gain weight, I might suffer from heart problems. I know I needed to take action, and that’s when I made a change in my life. It wasn’t instant, in fact, it took me a full year, but through diet, exercise, and visits to the doctor, I lost 50 pounds. I now weigh 130 at 5’5’’ and feel better than ever. I’m part of the soccer team, go to the gym frequently, and began to eat more healthier meals. I always remember how the journey wasn’t roses and daisies, I suffered through a lot when losing weight. My biggest challenge had to be eliminating junk food from my diet. Chips, cookies, soda, ice cream, candies, and chocolates, I had to give them all up in order to achieve my goal. I accomplished this by slowly eliminating one food category each month, until the healthy foods outweighed the unhealthy, and soon I began to crave healthy foods in the place or unhealthy ones. Overall, I’m glad with this change in my life and this helped me learn that change is possible with determination. 	I prefer working solo because I love the feeling I get when I overcome the challenge I’m faced with. However, the only reason I managed to lose weight is due to the overwhelming support I received from other, so I understand and do welcome working with teams. In fact communication is a vital aspect of life, so communicating with others in a team would be a great way to share ideas and learn from others. 	Last summer, I went to my parent’s home country, Ecuador to visit my grandparents. During my visit, I experienced a whole different lifestyle compared to the one I have in nyc. I had to milk cows, hike daily, travel to the city in the back of a truck, attend crazy parties, and pray, pray a lot. This trip was important to me not only because this was my first time in over 10 years seeing my grandparents, but because it gave me insight on a new kind of lifestyle, one that not many people have experienced, but I both enjoyed and struggled with during my time at Ecuador.	I would go to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) because every since I was a child, technology had always fascinated my and I really enjoy learning about new technologies that are being developed and created. I would study computer programming for this reason or possibly engineering. However my distance from MIT and the painfully low acceptance rate they have, as well as sudden bouts of procrastination, could prevent me from achieving this dream. 	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My principal/teacher/counselor recommended I apply	1	FALSE	FALSE

I would constantly ask others to help me read and spell which caused me to be embarrassed. In order to help me coup with this problem my parents got me a pocket dictionary and made me read constantly. Even though I'm not perfect now I am much more confident in my ability to read and spell on my own.	I usually prefer to work as a team because sometimes other people can help bring different ideas to the discussion. Group members could also explain things to each other if a member is confused. Although working alone can have its benefits like working at a faster pace and not having to discuss your stance on a problem with other group members.	Last summer I interned at a soccer camp for a month. I enjoy soccer and interacting with people which made this job perfect.	I would want to go to the Naval Academy. There I would want to study finances and politics because I want to work in finance and then go into politics.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	2	FALSE	FALSE

This class is the first time that I have ever been truly confused on what is going on and what am I doing. The struggle is not directly from the course content, but my teacher. My teacher is very friendly and conversates with his students on their day to day life, however, when it comes to teaching he appears rather useless to teaching us the core and developmental materials to understand the presented quizzes and test, start random conversations. It was frustrating because he continued to hand the class countless worksheets that we are clueless to solving, then wait around two days after it is due to solve it in front of the class. He does not even give an explanation of how the material is solved, just gives us answers. The worst predicaments are the quizzes and test since he changes the layout of the material. His extra help schedule does not help either because he looks at the answer then solves the problem without explaining the material you need to know. He argues with concerned students questioning him about grades and class averages and defensive when students tell him they are struggling. He presents us with questions we have not gone over nor on the study guides. This situation is not only affecting myself but the rest of the class. The quizzes and test are different from the packets and worksheets we are given in class which has caused low assessment grades and resulted in some students dropping out.   Despite my arduous first quarter, I have been adapting my studying and work ethic programs. In addition to assigned work from the teacher, every day I study/extra problems from online sources such as Khan Academy, teach myself from the textbook content, see other teachers in addition to mine for extra help and have scheduled tutoring sessions almost every Monday that has helped me to improve my grade.  	I have no problem with either or. I personally find both working alone and on a team similar because they result in a completion of a task. However, they differentiate by flexibility and structure. Working individually allows me to I manage myself at my own pace and ensure the completion of my task, use my own ideas and not be distracted. However, when working with a team, allows me to adapt to the group environment, enjoy the experience of sharing ideas, equally cooperating and contributing to the group to ensure the success of the task. In different events and situations, working as a team can be beneficial and equally enjoyable. I believe my open-mindedness, organization, and adaptability allows me to work well with others and solo.  	Last summer I participated in Outward Bound´s Oregon Rafting and Mountaineering Course. We navigated over and through mountains, rivers and canyons stretched across Oregon´s Central Cascades. The course expedition followed a 97-mile river trail through a memorizing scenic environment, the Deschutes River. The river was surrounded by a beautiful desert scattered with wildlife and unforgettable events. We learned about river hydrology, captaining skills, wildlife, Leave No Trace principles and basic camping lessons.Traveling down the river for the first six days of the course, you will learn paddle captaining skills, river hydrology, river safety, teamwork, campsite setup, backcountry cooking and Leave No Trace principles. The last of days we spent hiking into the Central Cascades with 45-pound packs holding our clothes, sleeping bags, food and camp essentials. In the Cascade Mountains, we hiked through the snow at 10,000 and higher elevation. We trekked through the forest, relied on finding freshwater lakes along the way to cook, hydrate and utilize. We learned the importance of teamwork and the various roles that were assigned to us each day (cook, navigator, cleaners, recorder etc..) Today I can still visualize my experience I had that summer, from the friendship bonds to being truly emerged in the outdoors.   In addition to last summer, I really wanted to participate in the All Star Coding program but was unable to due to overlapping summer plans like Outward Bound and family coordinated events. I would have missed around a week worth of the program, losing valuable material and information. It would also take away the chance for another student who would be able to fully commit to the whole extent of the program attendance. Over the past few month I have been looking forward to applying again to learn how to code and immerse myself in the tech entrepreneurship industry.  	If money were no object, I would want to study abroad for college. I believe that I will not only have the opportunity to learn in a new environment, but I would be exposed to what the world has to provide. My time abroad would give me exposure to new cultures, languages and a number of life experiences. In addition to studying abroad, depending on the area I go to, I will be able to develop and improve my language skills as a second language by experiencing it front hand and not just in a classroom.Studying abroad is so important to me because it will expand my interests, allow me to meet new people and ultimately help me develop my future.  In regards to my major, I would want to study either marine biology or a path in engineering focusing on the modernization of technology. I have always had a passion and excitement towards pursuing a career that improves marine life, solve global issues and utilizing my problem solving and creativity skills. I believe both areas of focus will allow me to tap into my strengths and explore things I am extremely passionate about. My time studying abroad in either field will provide me different perspectives on my studies that may not necessarily be provided in the U.S.  If anything would prevent me from achieving that dream it would be myself, because if I work hard and do what I have to do, I can achieve any dreams or goals I have set for myself.  	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	2	FALSE	FALSE

This event took place in the summer after 8th grade. My dad revealed to me and my older brother (Richard) that I had a 9 year old sister. Finding out I was an older brother took me by surprise since I had always been the youngest of the family. That same day we met and I couldn't think of anything to do other than get to know my nine year old sister. After being overwhelmed which such news, me and my older brother's greatest fear was not being able to see her anymore which concluded on me and him not telling my mother. The problem begins. Once my mother found out through a text on my dads phone, the whole household was at chaos. For about 4 months I can't think of a time I was home without an argument. My mother didn't speak to me for about a month which was the most challenging part of the whole situation. At the beginning of the chaos I made the decision to join some clubs to be occupied and not be home. I joined football. Football was my escape of the arguments, lectures, and mainly the depressing environment at home. After I joined football my whole mood changed. I was a happier, competitive, and fit person. After school it would be practice then homework and sleep. No time for any of the negativity at home. After a year or so things at home started to regulate themselves. My mom forgave my dad and most importantly me and my brother. The only bad outcome that is still a problem currently is that contact with my little sister has been completely cut off, but I plan to come back in contact with her once we're older. 	I prefer to work as part of a team because I enjoy giving and receiving ideas, working as a team to pick the best one, and then building a successful project with everyone doing their own part. 	Last summer I was hoping to join this program but once I was placed on the waiting list I decided to sign up for other internships. The other program I attended was a mentorship at the Hearst tower. The mentorship was amazing for the solely fact of meeting the CEOs of many companies and even the editor for Cosmopolitan Magazine. Being able to ask questions and have one on one conversations with people who have thrived and struggled to get where they are inspired me to do better this school year and thrive in my academics and clubs.	If money were no object I would attend NYU. I would study to be a Dermatologist. A Dermatologist is a medical practitioner qualified to diagnose and treat skin disorders. I grew up with a skin condition named Eczema. Growing up with a skin condition makes you cautious of your environment, weather, and your supply of lotion at all times. Always having to be self cautions of my skin has allowed me to grow a passion for it. My only obstacle preventing me from achieving this dream is that at times I can be lazy which would affect my studies.  	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My parent/guardian recommended I apply	3	FALSE	FALSE

I was in 9th grade at the time, and throughout my entire life, I was always good at math, whether I studied or not. I got hundreds in several test in sixth grade, and always had one of the top grades for Math exams and report card grades, but AP Calculus was completely different. I remember walking into the class on the first day thinking I was going to ace this class as the teacher had a good reputation for his students passing the AP exam. However, I was very wrong. Throughout the school year, I failed almost all quizzes and tests in his class and our teacher constantly reminded us that if you can't do well in this class, then you'll struggle severely if you want to be an engineer. I felt like I didn't belong in that class everyday and several people urged me to drop the class, but I knew that I didn't want to give up. At first I accepted that I wouldn't pass and accepted the 40s and 50s on test. However, one test, I got a 21 and from that moment on, I was determined to do whatever it took to pass his class and the AP exam. So I worked hard spending hours every night studying and then still failing tests.  However, I kept practicing and learned from my mistakes on tests. I made a gigantic leap and passed the AP Calculus AB exam. The entire AP Calculus experience taught me to be humble and to work hard for everything that you have and more importantly never give up without a fight.  	I prefer working as part of a team rather than working solo, but only if there is a good team. There isn't anything bad with working solo, but being part of team adds another element in problem solving as compared to working solo. That is because when working with a team, who shares the same goal that you do, that shares the same initiative and passion to solve a problem as you,  the element of teamwork arises. This element of teamwork combines brilliant minds and forms a variety of ideas and insights in solving a problem. The element of teamwork, in my opinion also provides a support group that eliminates any feeling of doubt or fear. Overall, a team saves time and makes the process of solving a problem more efficient as compared to working solo due to the element of teamwork.  	Last summer, I studied abroad in Beijing, China with 12 other kids across the United States in a program called Americans Promoting Study Abroad (APSA). I extended my knowledge in the Chinese language and culture, but more importantly I feel as if I opened my perspective and horizon in global citizenship and networking. I connected with people from the other side of the world and neglected our differences, but embraced our similarities. I met 12 other amazing kids from all of the United States and connected with them on several topics that are sensitive today. Lastly, I am assisting in opening the gateway for other kids across the United States to study abroad by volunteering as a web designer for a website, DOTTO.   	If money were no object, I'm not 100% sure what college I would go to since they are thousands of colleges in the United States, but I would most likely attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study mechanical or electrical engineering. When I was younger, I was always scared because I felt as I wasn't good enough to have a career in anything. Then I went to middle school and high school where learned my favorite subjects, physics, chemistry, and math/calculus and more importantly felt inspired by the impact of those subjects in society through engineering. The best college for engineering is MIT so that is why I would go there. However, the engineering field is very demanding on the mind and the body. The statistics show this as there are very few people of color going into the engineering field and that the engineering fields are one of the hardest to go through. However, I believe that no matter what college I go to, as long as I work hard and put my mind to become an engineer, I will become an engineer. 	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	SEED is to FRUIT	My friend participated in ASC (give name below)	1	FALSE	FALSE

I was having a hard time on my test and quizzes.  Although I studied, I was not getting the grades that I thought that I could get.  After trying different study strategies, I met with the teacher and studied with friends.  By the end of the semester my grades had improved significantly.	I enjoy working both solo and as a part of a team. I enjoy working alone because I get to figure things out and demonstrate what I know to people and myself. I also enjoy working as a part of a team because that allows me to learn while helping others.	Last summer, I built a 'computer assistant' program, that helps open applications by typing a word; it allowed the user to play games single or multiplayer (some of the games I made myself); and it also allows for somewhat of a real conversation. This was important to me because it allowed me to practice the skills that I learned during the school year.	I would like to attend MIT to study Computer Science or Engineering because I have always had an interest in building things and I feel that MIT could provide me with the tools I need to be successful in this field.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	1	FALSE	FALSE

I'm in between but probably part of a group because it gets more work done faster and I can learn more from that group.

I made up my mind to do something in programming when I went to Microsoft and our guide told us all the different benefits. Thanks to the Catalyst Network Foundation I also got to meet some vice president, executives, and bunch of other people from well known companies. 	I would probably go to a private college and Duke university would be one of the colleges I would go to. I would then go on to study computer science. An obstacle would probably be the work load because I heard in college you get twice as much work.

At midterm or progress report time, I had a "C" in the class. I had to seek out extra help from my teacher, do some online research/studying and do a lot of practice questions on my own. My performance started to improve and by the end of the semester I was able to earn a B+ in Chemistry. 	I like to work as a part of a team because different individuals bring different skills and ideas to a project. Each member of the team can help the others to grow.	Last summer I worked as a lifeguard at our community pool. This was important to me because it was my very first job. I had prepared by attending classes and studying to become both Red Cross and Nassau County certified. I enjoyed working with the team of lifeguards and liked the feeling of responsibility.   Another highlight last summer is that I obtained my drivers learner permit and took drivers education classes at our local high school. This was great because I want to be a safe driver! I believe the skills I was taught will help me in the future.	My dream college is Princeton or Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I want to study science and technology. These colleges have an excellent reputation of producing leaders and innovators, of which I hope to become.   The main obstacle is the cost of attending these prestigious colleges. 	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My parent/guardian recommended I apply	3	FALSE	FALSE

It was a challenging subject, and very different than any other subject that I had. taken before. However, I just had to focus and spend a bit more time studying, I tried to practice with my friends, neighbors, and sometimes my MOM who is learning Spanish at her healthcare job. A few times I even listed to Spanish TV stations, until I could understand more and more of the words. This year in 11th grade, I am actually taking Spanish 3 as an elective. I suppose that was a way for me to continue to challenge myself and tackle something new, until it is now becoming more familiar and comfortable.

After being in this school for over three years, my mother decided to change my middle school right after the Christmas break of my 8th grade year because she thought it would have been a better fit. I struggled academically because of the new material and different teaching styles of the teachers. I also struggled adjusting to the school's lifestyle as in making friends and involving myself in after school activities. Eventually, I joined the basketball team and began making friends and knowing the teachers more personally. 	Being that I have a passion for basketball, teamwork is very important to me. It is used in almost every aspect of my life. This is why I prefer to work in a team.   	On top of basketball being one of my passions, I also enjoy playing video games. During the summers, I usually travel to my mother's country to visit family, but last summer we were not able to go. Most of my summer consisted of playing basketball and video games. Eventually I grew an interest in one day creating my own video game and that is why I am applying to this program. I'd like to learn how to code and possibly get a job in this field. 	I am interested in going to Syracuse University ans studying computer science or computer gaming.

Mostly because in high school you are responsible for your own work and following your schedule. I had a hard time figuring out how to manage my time and school work.  It was especially difficult because I was placed in the wrong Language Arts class, that was supposed to be for 10th graders. No one found this out until half way through the school year.  By then it was too late to change. The teacher was very demanding and assigned a lot of work and expected college-level reading, writing, and analysis.  For example, in that one school year we read Odysseus, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Romeo & Juliet, and Death of a Salesman. For each book we had to write reports with annotations, and also took a lot of  comprehension and vocabulary tests.  At first I was very frustrated and also upset because I thought it was too much and that I would not be able to handle the work. I became overwhelmed, so I fell behind.  Then my mom sat me down and told me that though this was hard that I would be able to learn a lot if I tried, and that I would be able to handle the work better if I did not give up and did each assignment on time.  So I talked to the teacher and asked if I could make up a lot of the work and she said okay.  I did what my mom suggested and I passed the class. I am very proud that I did not quit, and that even though it got really hard I was able to find a way to get through that class. I appreciate that teacher now and the hard work because now I plan better for my classwork, tests, and other school assignments. I believe this is why I made it to honor roll this year. 	I used to prefer working solo because I found that I was more efficient that way, but then I started a programming club at my school and then I started to enjoy teamwork because then I am challenged to listen to the ideas of others; and a lot of times I find that when I work in a team other members of the team help me to approach the problem in a different way. Also, many times they come up with ways to deal with what we are working on that I did not think of.	I spent half of last summer at the National Summer Transportation Institute at Chenyney University, in Pennsylvania. It was as six week sleep-over program, and my first time staying away from home for a long time. This experience was important to me because I learned how to take care of myself and be responsible for my own time and getting the assignments done.  At the NSTI I worked with a team for the whole program to make a model of a truss bridge.  We also had to do a presentation about the engineering that we used to design and make the bridge.  This program was important to me because I had a chance to see how computers and technology affect transportation.  After NSTI, for the rest of the summer, I volunteered as a Sergeant Cadet, at the Teaneck Police Department Junior Police Academy.  I was a cadet the summer before.  As a Sergeant Cadet I helped the officers in charge with the training and activities for the new cadets. I really enjoyed this too because it helped me to build confidence and learn how to lead a group.	I would want to go to Full Sail University to study computer programming with a focus on game design.  I want to study game design because I have always been fascinated by gaming.  When I was in middle school, for fun, I reprogrammed a TI-84 Plus calculator into a RPG adventure game.  When the computer science teacher at my high school saw it he told me that I should continue pursuing programming and game design.  I like to express my creativity thorough story designs for games, across many genres such as RPGs, real-time strategy, and platformers, etc.  On my own I learned HTML5 and C++.  I am now studying C-Sharp.  I want to learn Java next.    An obstacle to going to Full Sail University may be whether my parents can pay for it.  It is very difficult to get financial aid and they have a lot of expenses that might make it difficult to pay for this school out of their pockets. 	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My principal/teacher/counselor recommended I apply	1	FALSE	FALSE

This was important to me because it made me realize if you really want something you have too work for it and that slacking off is not an option.  	.I prefer working in a team, while both working solo and as part of a team have their advantages and disadvantages,in a team if you have an idea someone else can help improve it and make it better,however when you are solo you might just never finish because you don't know how you might get stuck in a question  that you don't know the solution to which is why a group is preferred because someone may know that answer that you wouldn't even have thought of.    	Last summer i ran track for my school this is important to me because track is one of the things in my life that help me to work harder physically and mentally.	If money were no object i would go to MIT and I would study computer science.The reason for this is coding is the evolution of the new age 19th century calculators can basically be compared to computers, in a sense that calculators are too solve math problems that may consume time or may be too much work and coding is the same thing you make a code to do stuff that would normally take hours to finish.Some obstacles that might prevent me from achieving my dream might be the fact that i am an immigrant, and most immigrants don't get into such world ranked institution even if they work hard.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	My principal/teacher/counselor recommended I apply	2	FALSE	FALSE

Silently, I watched the faces around me scrunch up to contain their laughter. When I looked down, my arm was curved like the shaft of a bow; I fractured both bones and required immediate surgery.     In the weeks afterward, I developed my scar: an intense, elongated, purple-brown keloid covering the midsection of my forearm. It soon became a trigger of humiliation: something that forced me to relive the smirks and laughter of my teammates.    Coming to terms with such a drastic change to my body image has been gradual—something I have never really had to struggle with as a 6’2, skinny, able-bodied male.     In part, my difficulty to accept my scar began with my reluctance to reach out and be vulnerable. By taking steps out of my comfort zone—reaching out to peers who understand the struggle of personal perception from another perspective and entering spaces like the feminism club—I have been able to embrace my scar. Whereas I used to subconsciously hide it—tucking my left arm into my chest on the subway, or crossing my arms so only the lateral sides were visible—I now wear it, revealing its discolored, shiny surface for the world to see. While the emotional and physical trauma remain with me, carrying my scar has shown me how to accept and embrace mistakes and imperfections: they are special to me and they mold me into an individual.      	Although I believe working solo at times can be beneficial, I strongly believe there is immeasurable value in working in a team.    Two summers ago, I was fortunate enough to receive a full scholarship to attend an engineering program directed by Stanford professors, John Edmark and John Barton. In an environment with students from all around the world, from all walks of life, I learned that engineering is the craft of solving problems, collectively. It is an art of coming together as a team, bringing together one’s unique mindset and collaborating with others to attain a set goal.    One of the long-term projects was to create a solution to an everyday problem we faced on campus. My group was tasked with eliminating the pungent smells emitted from the conveyor belt in the dining hall. I am someone who usually likes to find the most pragmatic solution; I thought a simple and effective solution would be to separate the liquid waste from the solid waste. Another member of my team suggested installing ultraviolet lights above the conveyor belt could kill the bacteria causing the foul smell. She offered her perspective for an even more valuable and effective solution, something I would have never even thought about on my own.    To solve these problems, it is imperative to have diversity – not statistical diversity which is measured by numbers, but rather a diversity of story and thought. In tackling problems as a team, I believe our strength truly comes from our differences—they allow us to solve problems more effectively and creatively than we would be able to on our own.     	Last summer, I attended another engineering summer program. It centered around architectural, structural, and material design projects. In building a remote-controlled PVC pipe cutter, I explored aspects of mechanical engineering. Through prototyping bridges, canals and eventually a twenty-foot tall geodesic dome, I worked through the lens of a civil engineer. These projects and experiences gave me the opportunity to explore the unique intersection of the various domains of engineering.    In addition, I interned in the Chemical Engineering department at Columbia University, under a professor doing research to combat the effect of classism on air pollution in Bangladesh. Through an economic model, we studied how the rise of the economy has caused an exponential increase in air pollution within the last one-hundred years. First-handedly, I learned how engineering can extend into the realm of activism.     When I wasn’t in the city this summer, I was teaching myself to code in the Hardware Development Language (HDL). HDL is crucial to understanding the fundamental engineering behind computer science through a computer-based simulation. Instead of building the CPU or a memory card physically, I learned to simulate them on my computer by programming.     In my remaining free time, I ran, played soccer with my local high school team, and developed a newfound liking for pick-up basketball, helping me to rekindle old friendships.     	If money was not a challenge and I could attend any school, I would want to go to Stanford University to study computer engineering. I believe the next generation of societal leaders who will have a profound impact on their communities are not those who will work on Wall Street, in Boston, or in San Francisco. I believe, they will be the students who are not afraid to trek on unorthodox, non-traditional, and novel career paths; people with a passion to join a startup in Detroit or a tech company in Minnesota will be most able to have a direct impact to the people around them. I believe Stanford’s approach to higher education reflects this mentality and encourages students to take risks and pursue careers that they will truly enjoy and impact their communities.    I believe the most immediate challenge to that dream is, of course, the financial burden it would inevitably place on my family. I also believe that being across the country from the rest of my family would be personally difficult. Although I go to boarding school in New England, I am still reasonably accessible on a weekend or holiday for my parents to come visit. In California, the financial burden would only increase for plane tickets and for storing my belongings on breaks. Despite this, I believe that by taking advantage of scholarship opportunities I will be able to make this dream a feasible and realistic dream.      	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Other (please specify)	1	FALSE	FALSE

And while most kids coped by crying and being sad, I coped through eating. Excessively. It got to the point where my parents pulled me out of that school. But my overeating continued. And continued, and continued. Fast forward to 2016. I moved to Texas, and was determined to get in shape, lose fat, and improve my image. I worked hard, and the results were great. I lost 20 pounds, was exercising daily, and stopped overeating. My self esteem improved dramatically. Once a shy kid, now I'm  actively involved at my school and my church. 	I am very comfortable working on a team, but I can also work independently, as well. For example, I work the audio visual system at my church. My primary duty is to project songs, announcements, etc., on the projector. I also work with a team of 5 others, who handle lighting, sound, music, bulletins, and cameras. We all have our seperate tasks, but we all work together to get the job done. 	This summer, I took an SAT Prep/College Prep class at Hunter College. I learned test taking strategies and real life skills. I also did (and still do) humanitarian work, feeding the homeless every week, and providing them with basic necessities. 	If money were no object, I would go to Harvard University, and Get a BBA, and MBA, and a DBA, all with a concentration in Information Technology/Systems. Harvard has always been a dream school for me, but pretty out of reach, tuition wise.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ	13257	47	SEED is to FRUIT	My parent/guardian recommended I apply	2	FALSE	FALSE

My grade was a C- at first in my progress report card because I didn't quite understand what was required for each section in the lab reports. I met with the teacher after school and he explained to me how to answer the sections in the lab reports and how to maintain a consistent formality throughout it. Consequently, I was able to get a grade of a B, which I was happy with because that shows that I improved. 	 I prefer working solo because if I work in groups, I feel as if I would be a hindrance and would slow down everyone. I want to find out what area I failed in and then fix on that and develop myself. I think failure is an important step to becoming successful and if I work by myself, I will gain a lot of experience and knowledge. 	In the summer of 2017, I worked at Go Project, which is a great organization that helps young children with the subject that they are struggling with and even does 1 to 1 tutoring with them to ensure that they are confident in what they do. I worked there and helped the children math and science and worked alongside the teacher, and even the staff to make Go Project a welcoming place. 	    I would want to go to MIT to study computer science because I have a huge passion in computer science and I still don't know where to start. I want to create apps for the apple store, or make anything with the power of computers. I've been using my computer all my life and I fell in love with it and so now I want to learn how to completely use it to my advantage to help others. However, I was also thinking of NYU because it's closer since I live in New York and it also has a great computer science department. I know that there are tons of obstacles such as failures in computing certain stuff and I might be confused in learning something, but that's exactly what life throws at me so I can overcome it and stand out from the rest.	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6RLpvjClJPra6keQ686s-e_c8jbI9VxmRFLi8vuHiY-imLB0lc6CMZBswEz2IGdJLuL4eSsKB9D-_N7Frllr2LFhQwtVm_aqtJPegRE8RSV4g6IuBxSDYaE2BeIP5fwXsJLQIykeQ_k9xM0	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	Social Media	1	TRUE	FALSE

I ended up researching examples,descriptions, and videos on how flowcharts work. I used that information to create my own flowchart, but instead of just leaving it at that I ended up getting my friend to review my flowchart to make sure I wasn't over looking anything. I ended up getting 100 on my project.	If there is a assignment that is simple I prefer to do it myself because I don't want to split the work and have to trust the other person to do their part,"want something done right,do it yourself". I do though like working with people if the assignment is something that I can learn from and something that is big and more complex. The reason for this is because I feel that if its a subject that I don't have a full understanding of I can gain more knowledge from my teammates, and also the pressure of having other relying on me motivates me to learn and do more.	Last summer was the first time I took up coding(html and css code), I also started to read about marketing books, and these hobby's which I still participate in to this day, are important to me because It gives me a sense of accomplishment, like the more information I learn I have the closer I get to become successful.	I would like to go to stony brook college, and study in computer science and marketing/business, the reason why I would want to go to stony brook is because I love the campus and it seems to be a good place for computer science, and the reason why I want to take up computer science and marketing/business is because I want to do something having to do with online business, like creating websites for others and selling domain names.    The only obstacle that is in my way is myself. 	https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eb1Q3M-1QAosKUg8eP1fzE0fqVzV9Ab1FtxBdn61_nipvCCVnMCe8OSZlIR37mWg2c3bduHcU2CfvCwrhoz4RSrMQVP88pXsw8l5m2k2m10N6EME3VWd551svwXAofcr4rgM019HctnekDw	13257	44	LEAF is to BRANCH	ASC was at an opportunity fair I attended	1	TRUE	FALSE
