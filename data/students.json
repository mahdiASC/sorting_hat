They were basically teaching us how to make a website and also how to make an android app. At the end of the season, they told us to create a survey and make a website that might help the community or our school. I decided to make a website for our school clubs that would provide information about their different upcoming events and projects. The challenging part was definitely in making this idea come to life. How could I build out the website that I designed in my head? First, I used HTML to make the website, but this step only gave me basic foundations for how I imagined my website would be. I wanted to create a website that was attractive, but also very efficient. Then, my teachers suggested using CSS and Bootstrap. These were completely new tools for me. I became tired and even thought about quitting the project, but I did not lose hope because I am determined to learn how to code and create websites and applications that could make lives easier. I had some previous coding experience, so I relied on that knowledge to build on what I was learning with these new tools. I spent nights on the project and asked my teachers for help along the way. I finally completed the project, but even now, I am still working to make it even better.

Although I am Latino, I do not speak fluent Spanish, so I had an additional task of translating my analysis into a language that is not native to me. Due to the fact that I am also in AP US History and had a heavy workload from that class, I could not start researching this essay until 11:00 p.m. I was already mentally and physically exhausted, and I had been sleep-deprived for the entire week. I felt overwhelmed with this extremely difficult tests of stamina, endurance, and the ability to work efficiently all at once, and I was worried that I wouldn't sleep at all. To accomplish this task, I went upstairs, splashed some cold water on my face, and made a promise to myself that I would finish this assignment and still get some sleep. I worked relentlessly at this essay, breaking down the Spanish articles and writing notes for the audio as fast as I could, all while having an outline of the essay in mind. I had to work all night, and even though I only got 10 minutes of sleep, I had still accomplished my goal.

Leaving the comfort of my city to attend a small boarding school in Exton, Pennsylvania was not the most exciting plan at the time. Learning to be independent was a task easier said than done. But, little to my knowledge independence was the last thing I needed.   The environment I grew up in didn’t promote the wellbeing of my education. A failing grade was disregarded with the simple shrug of a shoulder and sarcastic hi-fives from other classmates. Yet my mind remained overflowing with unrealistic goals and aspirations.   Church Farm School was different. The student body is mostly made up of low income, students of color, a unique characteristic for a private high school. Every student that makes up Church Farm School was using this unique high school experience as an opportunity for a better future. With the mindset I grew up with, I’m not going to lie, I struggled immensely. Yes, classes were difficult but my lack of care was what stunted me from achieving good grades. This pattern continued until the end of my second year at Church Farm School. It wasn’t until I began hanging out with people who truly cared about me and my future, a few you may be familiar with, Samuel Jurcic and Nathan Antwi, when I changed. All the people I surrounded myself with drove me towards success as well as a challenge. Within one year I nearly doubled my previous GPA and still strive for improvement. Now, whenever I struggle or fail I know there will be a helping hand to reach out, pick me up and push me forward.   When I look back at my first two years at church farm school and even before that I learned a lot from my mistakes.

I grew up with the same people my whole life,and  the transition from a 15 minute commute to an hour commute, to Manhattan,  took a toll on my 10 year old mind. Physically, it became a strenuous deal for me, and socially it took even more of a toll on me. I didn’t know how to open up to other kids because everyone in my old school knew each other. I didn’t have too many social skills to tackle a new environment.   The first month of my new school was quickly the hardest thing that I had ever had to deal with especially with there only being two other kids of color in my class. This struggle in my social life made me into a shy individual. I never spoke to anyone, and I couldn’t until 3:20 hit so that I could return to my home with people I knew. Not speaking to anyone didn’t seem to big of a deal at first, but it became apparent that my lack of speaking skills would be problematic whenever I needed help.  In public school, the environment was completely different because I used to be one of the most advanced in my class. I never needed to go to the teacher to get help in a subject. I used to be the one who used to help my classmates.  At the time, I believed that I was exemplary in mathematics until the topics in private school started to become increasingly difficult. So, when topics started to get more difficult, I decided to stay quiet because of my embarrassment.   Students who struggled in my middle school, were often ridiculed which made me become embarrassed of the fact that I was also one of those struggling kids. After seeing how the result of staying quiet hurt me,  I came to the conclusion that it was worse to stay quiet in order to quell my embarrassment than to face my fears and approach the teacher to receive the help I need to become the student that I was in public school , and the student I could be again. In public school, my thoughts were never floating to the fact I would need help, and with my change in seeking help, I realize now that there is no need to be embarrassed about struggling.   This decision to seek help changed me as a person because it made me realize that everyone has something that they are afraid of, and there is nothing wrong with realizing that it’s important to know that even best need help sometimes. What seperates from others, is the ability to put away your fears, and embarrassment, to reach out and get the help needed to make you the best you that you could possibly be.

I was going to install a new 2 Terabyte hard drive into my gaming console (PlayStation 4).  I grabbed a multitude of screwdrivers and screw driver heads and began to open up the insides of what made this machine work.  I unscrewed the hard drive from the console to gain access to the raw hard drive.  The hard drive was screwed to a metal tray , so began to unscrew it to remove the old hard drive from the tray.  All was going good until 1 out of the 4 screws was stripped.  After an hour of trying different screwdrivers and screwdriver heads I dug through my father's tools and ended up having to bring out the 2 pairs of pliers and a hammer.  I took the screw, grabbed it with the set of pliers and wrestled the screw out of the tray.  I had complete wrecked the tray in which the new hard drive needs to be in.  I took the hammer and I forcibly hammered the wrecked tray back into place.  After using a second pair of pliers to wretch the stripped screw from the old hard drive into the new one.  I put the screws into the new two terabyte hard drive and screwed it into the awkwardly bent tray.  I finally inserted the into the console and put the console back together.  The challenging part of this project was, problem solving my way through having that strpped screw.  Although this was a tiring and tedious process, instead I persevered through and I now have two terabytes of space on my PlayStation 4.","logic_1":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ","logic_2":"13257","logic_3":"44","logic_4":"LEAF is to BRANCH","readscore":"2","rec":"FALSE","star":"FALSE","email":"xabtheman@gmail.com","race_secondary":[],"score":6,"travel_times":[],"rejection_messages":["Was not in 10th or 11th grade: 9th"],"preference":[6,2,7]},{"first_name":"KEVON","last_name":"PASSLEY","gender":"Male","race_primary":"Black","zip":"11226","state":"NY","city":"BROOKLYN","school_type":"Charter","grade":"10th","gpa":"3","f_aid":"Yes","f_lunch":"Yes","cs":"No","essay_raw":"I  struggled  with my last regents test last year and decided to  ask my teacher  and grandmother for extra help to stay committed on studing more frequent and staying focus","logic_1":"I don't know...yet!","logic_2":"71352","logic_3":"46","logic_4":"LEAF is to BRANCH","readscore":"1","rec":"TRUE","star":"FALSE","email":"kevonvpassley@gmail.com","race_secondary":[],"score":3,"travel_times":[{"cohort":"Google","time":2016},{"cohort":"Facebook","time":2156},{"cohort":"Goldman","time":1468},{"cohort":"JPMC","time":1642},{"cohort":"MLB","time":2056},{"cohort":"Cisco","time":2016},{"cohort":"Yahoo","time":2644}],"rejection_messages":[],"preference":[6,5,1]},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"Chino","gender":"Male","race_primary":"Hispanic/Latino","readscore":"2","rec":"FALSE","star":"FALSE","race_secondary":[],"score":"02","travel_times":[],"rejection_messages":["Was not in 10th or 11th grade: undefined","Was missing essay and/or logic answers","Did not have a zip code and/or state"],"preference":[5,6,0]},{"first_name":"Noble","last_name":"Ohakam","gender":"Male","race_primary":"Black","zip":"10469","state":"NY","city":"Bronx","school_type":"Private","grade":"12th","gpa":"3.4","f_aid":"Yes","f_lunch":"Not Applicable","cs":"Yes","readscore":"3","rec":"FALSE","star":"FALSE","email":"nobleohakam@gmail.com","race_secondary":[],"score":"03","travel_times":[],"rejection_messages":["Was not in 10th or 11th grade: 12th","Was missing essay and/or logic answers"],"preference":[4,0,5]},{"first_name":"LORNA","last_name":"TALBERT","gender":"Male","race_primary":"Black","zip":"11226","state":"NY","city":"brooklyn","school_type":"Charter","grade":"10th","gpa":"3","f_aid":"Yes","f_lunch":"Yes","cs":"No","readscore":"3","rec":"TRUE","star":"FALSE","email":"kevonvpassley@gmail.com","race_secondary":[],"score":4,"travel_times":[],"rejection_messages":["Was missing essay and/or logic answers"],"preference":[6,3,4]},{"readscore":"2","rec":"FALSE","star":"FALSE","race_secondary":[],"score":"02","travel_times":[],"rejection_messages":["Was not a male or self-described: undefined","Was not in 10th or 11th grade: undefined","Was missing essay and/or logic answers","Did not have a zip code and/or state"],"preference":[2,6,5]},{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"Rosario","gender":"Male","race_primary":"Hispanic/Latino","zip":"10467","state":"NY","city":"New York","school_type":"Public","grade":"11th","gpa":"3","f_aid":"Yes","f_lunch":"Yes","cs":"No","essay_raw":"During the beginning of tenth grade, I struggled greatly with Chemistry.

At the end of that semester I managed to raise my grade up to a B+, for a B+ in the overall class at the end of the year.","logic_1":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OS0wpZ0GeZM23FnjTN7LaTkphXb8dsvw3Up13aK3KjkFcYAsKXofjNk_SJn_NK5I9PsZjVv-wVISYsClq8HMNuYerLBFdBV6q5rAhkjEW2GvPWcPG8-DyfQKajY9_y_LAjtjhOAoxWyvjYQ","logic_2":"71352","logic_3":"44","logic_4":"LEAF is to BRANCH","readscore":"3","rec":"FALSE","star":"FALSE","email":"al61501@gmail.com","race_secondary":[],"score":6,"travel_times":[{"cohort":"Google","time":2275},{"cohort":"Facebook","time":2056},{"cohort":"Goldman","time":2082},{"cohort":"JPMC","time":2223},{"cohort":"MLB","time":2282},{"cohort":"Cisco","time":2275},{"cohort":"Yahoo","time":2078}],"rejection_messages":[],"preference":[5,7,6]},{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"Muflahi","gender":"Male","race_primary":"Neither","zip":"11435","state":"NY","city":"Jamaica","readscore":"3","rec":"FALSE","star":"FALSE","email":"muflahimohamed88@gmail.com","race_secondary":[],"score":"03","travel_times":[],"rejection_messages":["Was not in 10th or 11th grade: undefined","Was missing essay and/or logic answers"],"preference":[7,4,1]},{"first_name":"w344","last_name":"4343","gender":"Prefer to self-describe (elaborate here)","race_primary":"Neither","zip":"10467","state":"NY","city":"Bronx","school_type":"Public","grade":"11th","gpa":"3.7","f_aid":"Yes","f_lunch":"Yes","cs":"Yes","readscore":"1","rec":"FALSE","star":"FALSE","email":"gc.tushar@gmail.com","race_secondary":[],"score":"01","travel_times":[],"rejection_messages":["Was missing essay and/or logic answers"],"preference":[1,5,4]},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"Morocho","gender":"Male","race_primary":"Hispanic/Latino","zip":"11373","state":"NY","city":"Queens","school_type":"Public","grade":"10th","gpa":"3.9","f_aid":"Yes","f_lunch":"Yes","cs":"No","essay_raw":"When I was of 14 years of age, I suffered a lot with obesity. I weighted 180 pounds at only 5’4’’ and was constantly picked at for my weight. Even my friends, despite their good nature, told me I needed to lose some fat. During this time was when I started to feel depressed. I despised my body image and how it made me feel hopeless, worthless, and good for nothing. Luckily, I had a supporting family who understood what I was going through and did everything they could to make me feel better. They joked around, laughed, and gave me hope. They encouraged me to lose weight, but in a kind and friendly way. However, the turning point for me was when the doctor said that if I continue to gain weight, I might suffer from heart problems. I know I needed to take action, and that’s when I made a change in my life. It wasn’t instant, in fact, it took me a full year, but through diet, exercise, and visits to the doctor, I lost 50 pounds. I now weigh 130 at 5’5’’ and feel better than ever. I’m part of the soccer team, go to the gym frequently, and began to eat more healthier meals. I always remember how the journey wasn’t roses and daisies, I suffered through a lot when losing weight. My biggest challenge had to be eliminating junk food from my diet. Chips, cookies, soda, ice cream, candies, and chocolates, I had to give them all up in order to achieve my goal. I accomplished this by slowly eliminating one food category each month, until the healthy foods outweighed the unhealthy, and soon I began to crave healthy foods in the place or unhealthy ones. Overall, I’m glad with this change in my life and this helped me learn that change is possible with determination.

This event took place in the summer after 8th grade. My dad revealed to me and my older brother (Richard) that I had a 9 year old sister. Finding out I was an older brother took me by surprise since I had always been the youngest of the family. That same day we met and I couldn't think of anything to do other than get to know my nine year old sister. After being overwhelmed which such news, me and my older brother's greatest fear was not being able to see her anymore which concluded on me and him not telling my mother. The problem begins. Once my mother found out through a text on my dads phone, the whole household was at chaos. For about 4 months I can't think of a time I was home without an argument. My mother didn't speak to me for about a month which was the most challenging part of the whole situation. At the beginning of the chaos I made the decision to join some clubs to be occupied and not be home. I joined football. Football was my escape of the arguments, lectures, and mainly the depressing environment at home. After I joined football my whole mood changed. I was a happier, competitive, and fit person. After school it would be practice then homework and sleep. No time for any of the negativity at home. After a year or so things at home started to regulate themselves. My mom forgave my dad and most importantly me and my brother. The only bad outcome that is still a problem currently is that contact with my little sister has been completely cut off, but I plan to come back in contact with her once we're older.

I was in 9th grade at the time, and throughout my entire life, I was always good at math, whether I studied or not. I got hundreds in several test in sixth grade, and always had one of the top grades for Math exams and report card grades, but AP Calculus was completely different. I remember walking into the class on the first day thinking I was going to ace this class as the teacher had a good reputation for his students passing the AP exam. However, I was very wrong. Throughout the school year, I failed almost all quizzes and tests in his class and our teacher constantly reminded us that if you can't do well in this class, then you'll struggle severely if you want to be an engineer. I felt like I didn't belong in that class everyday and several people urged me to drop the class, but I knew that I didn't want to give up. At first I accepted that I wouldn't pass and accepted the 40s and 50s on test. However, one test, I got a 21 and from that moment on, I was determined to do whatever it took to pass his class and the AP exam. So I worked hard spending hours every night studying and then still failing tests.  However, I kept practicing and learned from my mistakes on tests. I made a gigantic leap and passed the AP Calculus AB exam. The entire AP Calculus experience taught me to be humble and to work hard for everything that you have and more importantly never give up without a fight.

Mostly because in high school you are responsible for your own work and following your schedule. I had a hard time figuring out how to manage my time and school work.  It was especially difficult because I was placed in the wrong Language Arts class, that was supposed to be for 10th graders. No one found this out until half way through the school year.  By then it was too late to change. The teacher was very demanding and assigned a lot of work and expected college-level reading, writing, and analysis.  For example, in that one school year we read Odysseus, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Romeo & Juliet, and Death of a Salesman. For each book we had to write reports with annotations, and also took a lot of  comprehension and vocabulary tests.  At first I was very frustrated and also upset because I thought it was too much and that I would not be able to handle the work. I became overwhelmed, so I fell behind.  Then my mom sat me down and told me that though this was hard that I would be able to learn a lot if I tried, and that I would be able to handle the work better if I did not give up and did each assignment on time.  So I talked to the teacher and asked if I could make up a lot of the work and she said okay.  I did what my mom suggested and I passed the class. I am very proud that I did not quit, and that even though it got really hard I was able to find a way to get through that class. I appreciate that teacher now and the hard work because now I plan better for my classwork, tests, and other school assignments. I believe this is why I made it to honor roll this year.

Silently, I watched the faces around me scrunch up to contain their laughter. When I looked down, my arm was curved like the shaft of a bow; I fractured both bones and required immediate surgery.     In the weeks afterward, I developed my scar: an intense, elongated, purple-brown keloid covering the midsection of my forearm. It soon became a trigger of humiliation: something that forced me to relive the smirks and laughter of my teammates.    Coming to terms with such a drastic change to my body image has been gradual—something I have never really had to struggle with as a 6’2, skinny, able-bodied male.     In part, my difficulty to accept my scar began with my reluctance to reach out and be vulnerable. By taking steps out of my comfort zone—reaching out to peers who understand the struggle of personal perception from another perspective and entering spaces like the feminism club—I have been able to embrace my scar.
